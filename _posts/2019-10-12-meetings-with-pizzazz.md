  We all did a great job recruiting this year.  We got a lot of new scouts.  Now
  comes the hard part, keeping those cub scouts.  We need a PLAN to keep them
  coming back.  A plan, and a bunch of meetings with Pizzazz!

Here are a couple of materials I supply my den leaders.  The first document I give to all new den leaders.  The other document is good for all leaders.  It gives them new areas around Katy they may not be familiar with.  It also gives them a bunch of games to play.  As we all learned, keep them activity!

I do plan on getting more of the survival guide books printed.  If interested send me an email.  If I get enough to order 30 I can get them for just at $7.
